MR. INCREDIBLE

Is this on?



INTERVIEWER

That's fine.



MR. INCREDIBLE

I can break through walls, I just can't...



INTERVIEWER

That's fine.



MR. INCREDIBLE

I can't get this on.



INTERVIEWER

So, Mr. Incredible...do you have a secret identity?



MR. INCREDIBLE

Every superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a
single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time?



ELASTIGIRL

Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this
at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know
what I mean?



FROZONE

Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret
identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I
said, ''Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.'' or
anything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a
super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good.



MR. INCREDIBLE

No matter how many times you save the world, it always
manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,
you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. ''I just cleaned up this
mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?''



INTERVIEWER

I could get to that point.



MR. INCREDIBLE

''Please?''



INTERVIEWER

Wait, no, don't get up. We're not finished.



MR. INCREDIBLE

Sometimes l think I'd just like the simple life, you know?
Relax a little and raise a family.



ELASTIGIRL

Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game!
I'm right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the
world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so.

POLICE RADIO

We interrupt for an important bulletin. A deadly high-speed
pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway, traveling northbound on
San Pablo Ave.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Yeah, I've got time.



OLD LADY

Mr. lncredible. Um, Mr. Incredible...



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

What is it, ma'am?



OLD LADY

My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.



[cat meows]



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Certainly, ma'am but I suggest you stand clear. There could
be trouble.



OLD LADY

No, no. He's quite tame.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Let go now!



[cat yowls]



POLICE OFFICER 1

Thank you, Mr. lncredible. You've done it again.



POLICE OFFICER 2

Yeah, you're the best.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No, I'm just here to help.



POLICE RADIO

Attention all units. We have a tour bus robbery...



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Tour bus robbery. I've still got time. Officers. Ma'am.
Squeaker.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Cool! Ready for take-off!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

What the...? Who are you supposed to be?



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Well, I'm lncrediBoy.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

What? No. You're that kid from the fan club. [stammering]
Brophy. Brody. Buddy! Buddy!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

My name is lncrediBoy.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Look, I've been nice, I've stood for photos, signed every
scrap of paper you pushed at me but this is...



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

No, you don't have to worry about training me. I know all
your moves, your crime fighting style, favorite catch phrases, everything! I'm
your number one fan!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Hey! Hey, wait!

BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

You know...you can tell a lot about a woman by the contents
of her purse, but maybe that's not what you had in mind.



THIEF

Hey, look--



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Elastigirl.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Mr. lncredible.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No, it's all right. I've got him.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Sure, you've got him. I just took him out for you.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Sure, you took him out. His attention was on me.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

A fact I exploited to do my job.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

My job, you mean.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

A simple thank you will suffice.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Thanks, but I don't need any help.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Whatever happened to ''ladies first''?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Well, whatever happened to equal treatment?



THIEF

Hey, look, the lady got me first.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Well, we could share, you know.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I work alone.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Well, I think you need to be more...flexible.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Are you doing anything later?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I have a previous engagement.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

[whistles]



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Now, you just stay here. They usually pick up the garbage
in an hour.



LUCIUS (FROZONE)

Hey, lncredible!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Hey, Frozone!



LUCIUS (FROZONE)

Shouldn't you be getting ready?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I still got time.



[crowd screaming]



WOMAN

He's gonna jump!



SANSWEET

I think you broke something.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

With counseling, I think you'll come to forgive me.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Wait a minute.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

[coughing] Bomb Voyage.



VOYAGE

[French] Mr. Incredible!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

And lncrediBoy!



VOYAGE

lncrediBoy?



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Hey, hey! Aren't you curious about how I get around so fast?
See? I have these rocket boots--



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Go home, Buddy.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

What?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Now.



VOYAGE

[French] Little oaf.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Can we talk? You always say be true to yourself, but you
never say which part of yourself to be true to. Well, I've finally figured out
who I am. I am your ward... lncrediBoy!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

And now, you have officially carried it too far, Buddy.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

This is because I don't have powers, isn't it? Well not
every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. I invented
these. I can fly. Can you fly?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.



VOYAGE

[French] And your outfit is totally ridiculous!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Just give me one chance! I'll show you. I'll go get the
police.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Buddy, don't!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

It'll only take a second, really.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No, stop! There's a bomb!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Let go! You're wrecking my flight pattern! I can do this if
you let go!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Will you just...? I'm trying to help! Stop!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Let go of my cape!

BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Take this one home. And make sure his mom knows what he's
been doing.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

I can help you. You're making a mista---hey!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

The injured jumper. You sent paramedics?



POLICE OFFICER

They've already picked him up.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

The blast in that building was caused by Bomb Voyage who I
caught in the act robbing the vault. Now, we might be able to nab him if we set
up a perimeter.



POLICE OFFICER

You mean he got away?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Well, yeah. Skippy here made sure of that.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

lncrediBoy!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

You're not affiliated with me! Holy smokes, I'm late.
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.



POLICE OFFICER

What about Bomb Voyage?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Any other night, I'd go after him myself, but I really
gotta go. But don't worry. We'll get him! Eventually!

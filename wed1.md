2) The array below represents a list of probabilities corresponding to each of the 10 different image classes we specified. The softmax function transform an array of normal numbers in probabilities between 0 and 1 that sum to 1. In this case it appears that the second value in the array shows that the software is nearly 100% confident that the image should be classified in image class 1, which corresponds to a trouser. The argmax function for this image produces the value 1, also corresponding to the image class trouser.

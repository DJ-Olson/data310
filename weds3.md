# Wealth Class Dataset

## Import the dataset city_persons.csv to your PyCharm environment
I ended up using Jupyter Notebook since pycharm was giving me some issues. To import the data into Jupyter Notebook I simply copied the data link and then downloaded a csv file to my desktop. I then used pandas to create a dataframe.


## Initially set the target to the least wealthy class, 2 in this case, and set all other wealth class outcomes to 0 (3,4 & 5)
This step was easy. The only thing that had to be changed from the provided script was setting the target value equal to 1. 


## Train, validate and test your model
Training the model required the column names to be changed. This dataset was not too hard to work with because the variables were numeric.


## Interpret and analyze your results. Did the model performance exhibit a particular trend?

# Part 1
Part 1 includes multi-class linear regression and a multi-class DNN regression using the provided target and features. The target was 'highway-mpg' and the features were: 'num-of-cylinders', 'engine-size', 'horsepower', and 'curb-weight.'

## Linear loss model and prediction plot

## DNN loss model and prediction plot

## Mean Absolute Error Table

Upon examining the graphs and the absolute error table it seems apparent that the linear regression model performed better than the DNN model.

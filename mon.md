# Part 1
Part 1 includes multi-class linear regression and a multi-class DNN regression using the provided target and features. The target was 'highway-mpg' and the features were: 'num-of-cylinders', 'engine-size', 'horsepower', and 'curb-weight.'

## 
Upon examining the graphs and the absolute error table, it seems apparent that the linear regression model performed better than the DNN regression model.


# Part 2
For the second part of the project I added new features to try to improve the models. The target stayed the same (highway-mpg), and all the old features remained, but I also added the features 'city-mpg', 'engine-type', and 'normalized-loss'.

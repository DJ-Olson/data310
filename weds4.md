# Image Combination Art

For this exercise I chose to merge two images that represented the way I have been thinking about this summer. For me this summer has been all about balancing my school work in the Jump Start Program and enjoying the summer. This summer has been the first time since Covid began that it feels like life has been somewhat returning to normal so I have found that in order to continue to work hard in the program, taking time to have fun and enjoy life has been essential. Thus, I chose two images that represent blanance and the work I have been doing. Below are the two images I chose to merge. The first represents balance and the second is a abstract pattern that is supposed to represent data science. 

## Balance

## Code Pattern

After merging the images I was pretty happy with the result. If I could change one thing I think I would choose a pattern with less blue becasue the original image has so much blue in the ocean. I think that a pattern that had a stronger contrast to the original image might have output a result that popped more.

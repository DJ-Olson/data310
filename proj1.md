# Project 1

## Question 1
### How did your model fare?
I chose the city of Denver for project 1 and created a dataframe with 200 homes data to create my predictive models. The mse of my model was 14.6, and after calculating this and examining the plots shown below, I believe my model to be fairly accurate for the amount of data used to create it. 

## Plot of model loss


In your estimation is there a particular variable that may improve model performance?
Which of the predictions were the most accurate? In which percentile do these most accurate predictions reside? Did your model trend towards over or under predicting home values?
Which feature appears to be the most significant predictor?
